# Resume

This is a version of my résumé that I wrote in HTML and CSS to achieve the look and feel that I wanted more easily. The kind of visual flair that I was going for was not easy to create using standard word processing tools, and it seemed appropriate to write my résumé using some of the same web development skills that my employers will be looking for in potential candidates.

# Printing

I wanted to makes sure that my résumé worked well both in its digital version and as a printed document (PDF or hard copy). Therefore, I spent considerable time tweaking the CSS rules for the `@media print` type.
